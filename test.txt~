QiQiQiQiQiQuestion: When is interest in investing in the Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) of Straits Times
Index (STI) the highest? Is there higher interest in investing in the STI or in the S&P 500?
One of the most common recommendations for new Singaporean investors is to invest in a
Straits Times Index (STI) exchange traded fund (ETF). The STI is regarded as a reliable indicator
of how the Singapore stock market is performing which contains 30 of Singapore’s largest and
most liquid blue-chip stocks (e.g., DBS, UOB, OCBC). This can be done through the Nikko AM
Singapore STI ETF (SGX: G3B).
However, investing in the US stock
market (S&P 500) which consists of
largest publicly traded companies in
the U.S. is also very popular among
investors for its growth prospects
and diversification. Interestingly,
the S&P 500 consists of 500
companies with 505 different stocks
as companies like Google have
multiple share classes. This can be
done through the Vanguard S&P 500
ETF (VOO).
Figure 1
My research will use the pytrends API from 1 January 2020 to 1 January 2021 in Singapore. I
predict interest in STI to be the highest in January and July as these are the months when the
STI ETF pays their dividend. Also, interest in January should be highest as I think many people
want to start investing as part of their new year resolution. My belief is partially correct as
the months with the highest interest in G3B are January, March, May, and November in 2020
(refer to figure 1).

Figure 2

I believe interest in G3B should be higher than VOO because of home bias where investors
tend to invest most of their portfolio in domestic equities (Chen, 2020). My prediction was
wrong as interest in VOO was far higher than in G3B (refer to figure 2). Furthermore, is
interest highest in both VOO and G3B when the prices of both ETFs are near their 52-week
lows and whenever they break their 52-week highs. Unsurprisingly, suggestions, and related
queries were all about their share prices.
